### Running Python code:

Everything you'll need to do is to type on your terminal: 

`$ python Hangman.py`

Alternatively, you could add a shebang (`#!`) on the header of your script, so your terminal can call the right interpreter to run your code:

```python  
#! /usr/bin/env python  
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-  
```

In addition you've got a line for setting the default enconding of your script. Now you could set the execute permission of your file:  

`$ chmod u+x Hangman.py`  

and then simply type on your terminal:  

`$ ./Hangman.py`

# JAVA Hangman

## This is the JAVA version of the Hangman Program

To run this code, it is recommended to use an IDE . I work on eclipse, you're free to use anything that suits you.

#### So this little application is made using maven for building and dependencies.
#### Maven
Maven - Build Tool ( used for taking all the classes containing your code bundling it together and making it a jar which you can then run )
for more info on maven : https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/

So, for running this on an IDE import the project into workspace as maven project and then run the class 
### com.floppylab.refactor.Hangman.java as JAVA application and that should get you the game up and running in your IDE's console

Since we're also using Maven, you can also just open the Hangman folder in cmd and run
### mvn package

The above will cause maven to build a jar and place it in a folder target within the Hangman folder
After that you can run the jar from command line by doing
### java -jar hangman.jar

And thats it, its up and running.

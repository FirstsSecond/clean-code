To compile, you need GCC or Clang installed.
The compiler must at a minimum support C++11.

* gcc: ```g++ hangman/main.cpp```
* clang: ```clang++ hangman/main.cpp```

* To change the name of output file (a.out by default) ```g++ -o output_file_name  main.cpp```

To run, on the command line run the command ```./a.out``` on Unix or ```.\a.exe``` on Windows.
